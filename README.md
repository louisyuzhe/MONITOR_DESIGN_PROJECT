# MONITOR_DESIGN_PROJECT-
The goal of the project is to build a monitor program for the Motorola 68000 microprocessor with CISC assembly language. The program is breakdown into 4 parts which is the command interpreter, debugger commands, exception handlers and a user instruction manual. The command interpreter is a loop that recognizes command entered, and branches to subroutine(s) for executing this command. If there is no match, it displays an error message. It is also capable of adequate error handling and error checking.
The program can perform twelve essential debugger functions such help, memory display, sort(word), memory modify, memory set, block fill, block move, block test, block search, go function, display formatted registers, and exit. Besides, my monitor program can handle 8 common exceptions such as address error, bus error, illegal instruction, division by zero, check instruction error, privilege violation, Line A and F emulator, and privilege violation error. All the work was completed within the timeframe of 3 weeks.
